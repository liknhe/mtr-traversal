# MTR-Traversal

Our submission for the Data Structure and Algorithms module(CS2310)
The assignment tasked us to create utilities to help users to navigate the Hong Kong Train System, and demonstrate our understanding of the module contents.

The implementation follows the MVC framework, and the MTR is mapped as series of nodes and connecting edges.
This data representation is essential to the last functional requirement which allows users to query the connecting path between any two stations.

A DFS path finding algorithm is implemented and refined to a linear time complexity, O(n).
